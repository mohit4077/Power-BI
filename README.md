# Power Bi project
Project Overview:
The project centered around leveraging a real dataset capturing employee presence within an organization. The primary objective was to develop an informative dashboard using Power BI, offering valuable insights into various aspects of employee attendance and related metrics.

Key Project Components:

    Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
    Utilizing Power Query, the project involved a meticulous process of cleaning and preprocessing the raw dataset. This step ensured the data's quality and consistency, laying a solid foundation for subsequent analysis.

    Function Creation for Reusability:
    To enhance efficiency and facilitate future analyses, a custom function was crafted. This function streamlined the data cleaning and preprocessing steps, promoting reusability and consistency in handling similar datasets.

    Dashboard Creation:
    The core deliverable of the project was a comprehensive Power BI dashboard. This dashboard incorporated a range of visual elements and data representations to provide a holistic view of employee attendance within the organization.

    Analysis Focus Areas:
    The dashboard prominently featured line charts, metrics tables, and power cards to highlight key insights. The analysis spanned crucial aspects such as:
        Employees Attendance: Visualizing attendance patterns over time, identifying trends and anomalies.
        Work from Status: Providing insights into the distribution of employees working from different locations.
        Sick Leave Percentage: Analyzing the proportion of sick leave taken by employees.

    HR-Centric Insights:
    The chosen visualizations and metrics were carefully selected to cater to HR needs. The dashboard aimed to empower HR professionals with actionable insights to make informed decisions related to workforce management.

By combining robust data preprocessing techniques, the creation of reusable functions, and the strategic use of Power BI visualizations, the project successfully delivered a dynamic dashboard tailored to the unique requirements of tracking and understanding employee presence within the organization.
